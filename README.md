# Yggdrasil

Yggdrasil is a project which permits, if added in your favorite shell, to create and configure easily shell environment. Each variables declared in a context will be available only in this context. When the context is changed, the specific environment variable of this context will be unset. In addition, it print the current context on your shell line.

## Getting Started

This file regroups instructions on how to install this project and how to use it.

### Installing

First, use install.sh to add the Yggdrasil's configuration directory.

```

Then add this line in your .zshrc/.bashrc to use this project 
```bash

```

And reload your current shell with `bash` or `zsh` command.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

Normally, if this work, you should see this `(â™Ž  None)` appear in your ps1 line. It represents the current context (in our case None which represents no-context).
